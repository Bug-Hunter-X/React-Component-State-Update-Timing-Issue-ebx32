# React Component State Update Timing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React applications related to updating component state after an asynchronous operation.  The `BuggyComponent.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, while `FixedComponent.js` provides a corrected version.

The bug arises from using `componentDidMount` to set state after fetching data.  The `componentDidMount` lifecycle method only runs once, and there's no guarantee the asynchronous operation will complete before rendering is finished. This might lead to an initial render with empty or stale data.

The solution involves using `useEffect` with the empty dependency array (`[]`) to ensure the asynchronous operation runs only once after mounting, and then updating the state. The component will re-render once the data is fetched, properly displaying the information.
